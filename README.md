## Introduction

Urban Oasis Mall is a popular shopping destination located in the heart of Johannesburg. However, finding a parking spot has been a significant challenge for our customers, leading to frustration, congestion, and revenue losses. To address this issue, we are introducing an AI-driven Smart Parking System.

This system aims to provide real-time updates on parking spot availability, optimize parking allocation, enhance the customer experience, and ensure regulatory compliance. The system leverages cutting-edge technologies, including object detection algorithms, machine learning, deep learning, and time series analysis, to achieve these goals.

## Solution Components

### Hardware Requirements

- **Cameras and Sensors**: To detect vehicle presence in parking spots.
- **Processing Unit**: For data analysis and object detection.
- **Network Connectivity**: To enable real-time data transmission.
- **Storage**: For storing images and data.
- **Display Screens**: To inform users of parking spot availability.
- **Power Supply**: To ensure uninterrupted operation.

### Object Detection Algorithms (YOLO)

We employ the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time object detection. YOLO's speed and accuracy make it ideal for detecting cars in parking spots.

### Real-Time Sensor Data

Real-time sensor data complements object detection, providing occupancy information. This data is crucial for accurate parking updates.

### Machine Learning Models

We utilize supervised learning models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify parking spots based on sensor data.

### Deep Learning Models (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) automate object detection, improving accuracy over time. These models are trained on labeled data to identify patterns and enhance real-time predictions.

### Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis helps identify occupancy patterns, make predictions, optimize parking allocations, adjust pricing, and detect anomalies. It enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of our parking management.

### Real-Time Reporting and Analytics

Our system integrates real-time data from sensors and object detection algorithms, presenting visual maps, real-time updates, and statistical analysis to assist users in making informed parking decisions.

### User-Friendly Interface

A user-friendly interface provides easy access to parking spot availability and occupancy information through visual representations.

### Scalability

The system is designed to handle a growing number of sensors and parking spots to accommodate increasing demand.

### Data Storage and Management

Efficient data storage and management handle large amounts of sensor data and historical records securely.

## Constraints

- **Cost**: Implementing AI-based parking management can be expensive.
- **Complexity**: Developing and maintaining AI systems require expertise.
- **Data Accuracy**: Poor data quality can impact system performance.
- **Maintenance**: Regular maintenance is needed to ensure optimal performance.
- **Privacy and Security**: Protecting sensitive data is critical.
- **Scalability**: The system must scale with demand.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Compliance with local laws and regulations is essential.

## Risks

- **System Malfunction**: Malfunctions can lead to incorrect information.
- **Technical Expertise**: Skilled professionals are required.
- **Cybersecurity**: Data collection poses security risks.
- **Privacy**: Handling sensitive data must comply with regulations.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Non-compliance can result in fines.
- **False Detections**: AI may produce false alarms.

## Problem Definition

Urban Oasis Mall faces parking challenges, including customer frustration, congestion, and revenue losses due to inefficient parking management. Our AI-driven Smart Parking System aims to provide real-time updates on parking spot availability, optimize allocation, enhance the customer experience, and ensure regulatory compliance.

This system leverages object detection, machine learning, deep learning, time series analysis, and real-time reporting to solve these problems efficiently and effectively.
